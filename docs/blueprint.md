# **App Name**: SimuSched

## Core Features:

- FCFS Simulation: Simulate CPU scheduling using the First-Come, First-Served algorithm and provide a visualized output.
- SJF Simulation: Simulate CPU scheduling using the Shortest Job First algorithm and visualize the results.
- Priority Scheduling Simulation: Simulate CPU scheduling using a priority-based algorithm, showing waiting and turnaround times, and visualize the results.
- Round Robin Simulation: Simulate CPU scheduling using the Round Robin algorithm with configurable time quantum and show related metrics.
- Gantt Chart Visualization: Generate a Gantt chart to visually represent the CPU scheduling timeline for each algorithm.
- Performance Metrics Tool: LLM tool analyzes simulation outputs (waiting time, turnaround time) to suggest the best scheduling algorithm based on user-defined performance criteria, and suggest mitigation strategies for trade-offs and starvation scenarios.
- Context Switching Analysis: Calculate and display the number of context switches that occur during each scheduling simulation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to reflect the technology and simulation aspects.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5) for a clean and modern interface.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#FFB347) to highlight important metrics and interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers, providing a modern and technical feel, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, offering clarity and readability.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying scheduling algorithms and related code snippets.
- Use minimalist icons to represent different scheduling algorithms and metrics.
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations to enhance user interaction during simulations.
